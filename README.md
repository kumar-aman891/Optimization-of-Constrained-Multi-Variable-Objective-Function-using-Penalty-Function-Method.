# Optimization-of-Constrained-Multi-Variable-Objective-Function-using-Penalty-Function-Method.
The project is spreaded across 3 phases.
Phase1:Extreme Point Calculation of a function
Phase2:Optimization of Multivariable Function
Phase3:Optimization of Constraint Objective function By Penalty Function Method.
The programe developed in phase1 and phase2 are utilized in solving the problem statement of phase3.
The flow of the project across different phases could be understood well from the link under:
